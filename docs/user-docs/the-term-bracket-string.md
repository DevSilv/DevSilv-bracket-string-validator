# The term "bracket string"

The original, polish counterpart of the expression "bracket string" is "_wyrażenie nawiasowe_". The term "[_wyrażenie_](https://www.diki.pl/slownik-angielskiego?q=wyra%C5%BCenie)" may be translated as "expression", "phrase", "wording" and several other words. The term "_nawiasowe_" is an inflected adjective of the term "[_nawias_](https://www.diki.pl/slownik-angielskiego?q=nawias)", which may be translated as "bracket".

So, the literal translation could be "bracket expression". I have decided to translate it non-literally because I had not found any other translation. The term "expression" seemed to me too ambiguous to choose; it may mean several quite distinct things in development.

Instead, I have deviced to use the term "string" because these "expressions" are substantially used as strings (i.e. sequences of characters) in the application.

If you find the translation, or the whole use of the term "bracket string", incorrect in the context of this application, please create an issue.
